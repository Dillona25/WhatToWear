# What to wear:

Its simple. What to wear is a project that takes a users loaction and the weather in the specified location and then suggests clothes for the user to wear. The user can add and delete clothes in their closet. The project was made using React.js and CSS. I created and programmed an entire back-end and server using node.js, express.js and mongoDB to seamlessly take care of the users requests here on the front-end.
